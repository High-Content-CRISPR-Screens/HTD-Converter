# HTD Converter

This FIJI script opens htd files from high-throughput screens acquired in MetaXpress inside of FIJI 
and converts them into TIFF format.

## How to use:
Open the ijm file by dragging it into FIJI. 
Select the HTD file in the outer directory.
The script will create a new folder with the images in the same folder as the HTD file.
